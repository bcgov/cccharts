The file `swe_depth_anomalies_1950_2014.csv` contains annual anomalies from the 1981-2010 30 year normal, for snow water equivalent (swe) and depth on April 1, for all snow stations used in the analysis. 

The file `ecoprov_swe_depth_anomalies_1950_2014.csv` contains annual anomalies for swe and snow depth for each ecoprovince for the same time period. These were generated by interpolating the station-level data into a gridded product, and an average for each year and region was taken.
